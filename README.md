# Bangladesh Police Crime Statistics Analysis & Prediction

A complete data analysis and forecasting project built using **Python** to explore, visualize, and predict crime trends across different divisions and years in Bangladesh.  

This project combines **Data Preprocessing**, **Statistical Modeling**, **Machine Learning**, and **Interactive Visualizations** to provide deep insights into national crime patterns from **2019 to 2025**.

## Project Description

The **Bangladesh Police Crime Statistics Analysis** project is designed to analyze real crime data reported across Bangladesh police units.  
It includes both **Exploratory Data analysis (EDA)** and **Predictive Modeling** steps. Using libraries like **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly**, it visualizes seasonal patterns, high-crime regions, and top crime categories.  
The system also uses **ARIMA**, **Exponential Smoothing**, **Linear Regression**, and **Random Forest** models to forecast upcoming crime trends for each division.

This project can help policymakers, data analysts, and law enforcement departments **Identify Trends, Allocate Resources**, and **Take Preventive Actions** based on data-driven insights.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, formatting, and organizing multi-year police records.  
- **Static Visualization:** Monthly and yearly trends, regional heatmaps, and category comparisons.  
- **Interactive Dashboards:** Dynamic exploration with Plotly (time-series, bubble maps, pie charts).  
- **Machine Learning Forecasts:** Predicts top 5 crimes for next month using ARIMA, ETS, Linear Regression, and Random Forest.  
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Detects regional hotspots and visualizes them on a Bangladesh map.
